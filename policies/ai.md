# Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for the use of AI assistants and AI tools within the organization to ensure that they are used in a secure and responsible manner.

# Scope
This policy applies to all employees and contractors who use AI assistants and tools as part of their job responsibilities.

# Background 
As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies continue to evolve and become more prevalent in various industries, many companies are adopting AI-powered tools to improve their workflows and increase efficiency. This includes the use of AI assistants and tools like ChatGPT, Github Copilot, and other similar tools.

While these tools offer many benefits, they also bring new security and compliance risks to organizations. The use of AI-powered tools can introduce vulnerabilities, raise ethical concerns, and potentially compromise sensitive data.

Therefore, it is important for organizations to develop policies and guidelines for the responsible use of AI-powered tools, taking into account the specific risks and challenges that come with their use.

## Reporting and Monitoring
Employees and contractors must report any suspected security or privacy breaches related to the use of AI assistants to their supervisor or manager immediately for investigation and remediation. The organization may also monitor the use of AI assistants to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect the security and privacy of the organization.
