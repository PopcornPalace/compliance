The scope of this policy encompasses all data within DoubleGood Technology's systems and applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who have access to the data.

# Policy
The following guidelines and requirements apply to configure monitoring and alerting for backup and recovery process:

## Backup Alerting and Monitoring Process
a. Alerting and Monitoring: Activating and configuring notifications to monitor AWS Backup jobs provides the awareness of your backup activities, helps ensure that critical service-level agreements (SLAs) are met, enhances business-as-usual monitoring, helps meet compliance obligations. Set up monitoring configuration to obtain notifications when backup or restore, or copy jobs either failed, pending or in successful state to be informed about backup and restore process.

b. Backup Notifications: An important aspect to protecting assets is the ability to monitor backup, restore, and copy jobs. Awareness of backup and restore job status is critical to ensure that the protection plan is executed according to service-level agreements (SLAs) and meets compliance requirements. Failed backups, restores, and copy jobs can negatively affect workflows and SLAs. The ability to get notifications on job status can enhance the efficiency and efficacy of compliance and operational procedures.

## Policy Review and Updates
a. Regular Review: The alerting and monitoring policy, including the backup and restore aspects, shall be reviewed periodically to ensure compliance with changing legal and regulatory requirements.

b. Policy Updates: Any necessary updates or revisions to the alerting and monitoring policy shall be documented, communicated, and implemented accordingly.
